Here is how we do things at a wave press. I mention these things ahead of time to be as transparent as possible and because there has been confusion about the standard release procedure in the past that has lead to avoidable situations. I hope the following sounds reasonable:

## AWP Payment
* AWP will give you 10% of the run as an in-kind honorarium / payment. You are free to do whatever you want with these copies, but we recommend selling them at shows
  * After your 10% you may be able to negotiate purchase of additional copies (at cost) from the label, though the amount we are able to sell at cost will depend on sales
* AWP will supply you with 100 download codes with which you are free to do whatever you want. Need more? Just ask, we have so many it's ridiculous!
* AWP will write a press release and distribute it and a digital comp of the album to our list of critics / press people as part of promotional efforts

## AWP Manufacturing and Design
### Manufacturing
* AWP run size is 300
* AWP will cover all manufacturing costs related to creation of the physical edition of this release

### Design
* AWP has an amazing designer who will design the release. He will produce 2 versions and you can pick which of the 2 you prefer.
  * If you have images you would like to submit, which I will pass to him and that he may or may not use or alter, we are open to that
  * All releases on a wave press have a “frame" as part of the design. The frame typically lists artist, title, catalogue number, and logo in corners on back and front. This frame is a critical feature of the design of AWP releases, as it assists with visual consistency across different formats

## AWP Sales
* Sale price for CS / CD / 7” / 12” on AWP is $8 / $10 / $10 / $20, digital is $5 for everything but 12” (12” digital is $10)
* AWP sells via bandcamp and in-person, or via select mail order services
* Digital versions of releases published by a wave press are exclusively available from the AWP bandcamp page. AWP does not currently use Apple Music, Spotify, etc..
  * We ask that the digital version of the release remain exclusive to the a wave press bandcamp until we have broken even on expenses for the physical version of the release

## AWP Caveats
* Do not schedule tours or release shows for AWP releases until we have the release in hand
  * We cannot guarantee manufacturing estimates and have had negative experiences with people scheduling release shows based off of them in the past
* We do not send free physical copies to reviewers because those reviewers don’t always review those copies and often sell them on discogs later
* We are not professional shipping clerks and sometimes find ourselves in situations that are more complex than we would like (particularly when shipping bulk items internationally). This part of a wave press is admittedly a work-in-progress
  * We use a Pasadena-based packaging company to help us make boxes and safely package merch for bulk orders. Since we started doing this we have virtually eliminated any instance of merch getting damaged in transit, particularly when shipping to other countries. The additional cost is negligible and is part of shipping
* We ask that you keep in mind that everything we do with a wave press is in good faith because we value your work and want to share it with others. We make almost no money doing this and just do it because we think sharing new work by people we like is important

Sound okay? Hope so!
