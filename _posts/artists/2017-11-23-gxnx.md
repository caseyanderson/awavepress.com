### bio
In the beginning stages Glorias Navales (Viña Del Mar, Chile) was an acoustic guitar duo. After a while a handcrafted “Bailes Chino” Drum and a Rabel were incorporated, transforming the duo into a trio. The trio rehearsed constantly in a basement in Santiago, Chile.

Different origins were gathered around the triangle formed by the band.

After a year or so of creation a cassette came out on Traición 73 Records followed soon by the group’s first live presentations. Shortly thereafter KYE records published Glorias Navales’ first LP, Cofradía Náutica, a collection comprised of live recordings and performances recorded privately in their home studio.

A while later the band incorporated a Ukulele before departing to tour Europe. The rule: only acoustic instruments, no effects. The recordings that comprise Glorias Navales Presenta El Blues de Istvan were made after this tour.

Melancholy and hope join intuitively in basic and repetitive melodies.

Glorias Navales is
