### bio
Soprano, sound artist, and voice coach Micaela Tobin specializes in contemporary voice, recently performing with the acclaimed Los Angeles-based experimental opera company The Industry in their groundbreaking production of Hopscotch—a mobile opera for 24 cars (dir. Yuval Sharon). Credits also include the West Coast premiere of John Luther Adam’s Sila: The Breath of the World, (2015 Ojai Music Festival), and as a soprano soloist alongside Annette Bening in Medea at UCLALive. The recent premiere of her original experimental opera, Unseal Unseam, received a five-star review at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in the Summer of 2016, and was described as "hypnotic" and "paralyzingly beautiful" by New Classic LA after it's U.S. premiere in October of 2017.
