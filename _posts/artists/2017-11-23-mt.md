### bio
Soprano and sound artist Micaela Tobin is interested in reconciling the construct of the soprano through the genres of noise and drone. She dissects her operatic style of singing through the use of electronic effects pedals and looping stations. The recent premiere of her original experimental opera, Unseal Unseam, received a five-star review at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in the Summer of 2016, and was described as "hypnotic" and "paralyzingly beautiful" by New Classic LA after it's U.S. premiere in October of 2017.
