### bio
Experimental vocalist Carmina Escobar is a creative performer, improviser, sound and intermedia artist from Mexico City. Her work focuses primarily on sound, the voice, the body and their interrelations to physical, social and memory spaces. She has intensely explored the capacities of her voice developing a wide range of vocal techniques that she applies not only to her performance and creative practice but also to investigate radical ideas and concepts regarding the voice. In her artwork the Voice is the phenomenon and conceptual trigger that links all the materials, analogue or digital, in order to create an experience that sets in motion the audience perception. She has presented her own work in diverse festivals, biennials, experimental venues, formal concert halls and living rooms of the Mexican Republic, the USA, and Europe.
