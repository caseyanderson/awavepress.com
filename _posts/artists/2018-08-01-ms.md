### bio
Matt Sargent is a composer and guitarist based in upstate New York.  His music grows out of an appreciation of natural resonances, recursive structures, computer modeling, and outdoor listening. His recent work has been focused on systems of intonation and possible dialogues between musicians and responsive scores. 

His album “Ghost Music,” a collaboration with Bill Solomon (Bent Duo), was released on Weighter Recordings in 2018. Bill Meyer of Wire Magazine writes, “This music isn’t about following in anyone’s footsteps; it uses bare resources to establish a bounded and essential space.”

Matt is a visiting assistant professor of electronic music and sound at Bard College.
