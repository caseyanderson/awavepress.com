<h2>Bio</h2>
**Jason Kahn**

Born 1960 in New York, Jason Kahn is a musician, artist and writer. He lives in ZÃ¼rich.

As an electronic musician, guitarist, vocalist and percussionist Kahn collaborates with many international musicians in the context of free improvised music. He has also composed numerous electro acoustic pieces and graphical scores written for specific groups and musicians. His work can be heard on over two hundred solo, collaborative and compilation releases.

Kahn's installations and interventions have been shown in museums, galleries, art spaces and public sites internationally. These works focus on the idea of space: the conceptual and physical juncture points, its production and dissolution, and our relation to it as a political, social and environmental medium.

Kahn's written work has appeared in books, magazines and as liner notes to many audio publications. He has published four books: "Infinity Suite" (2020), "Voice and Sky" (2018), "Space Text Sound" (2017) and "In Place" (2015).

Kahn's other activities include sound pieces for radio, film, dance and theater. He has also designed numerous CD, LP and cassette covers.

Kahn has performed and exhibited work in the United States, Europe, Argentina, Australia, Egypt, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Korea, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, Turkey, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan.

In 2011 Kahn started the Editions imprint to publish his own recordings and writings.
