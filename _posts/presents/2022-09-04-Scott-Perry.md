This concert will feature works for Microtonally tuned virtual pianos placed in a Coaxial's surround playback system. "Fantasy in 72EDO for Six Virtual Pianos" is an exploration of the closely approximated 13-Limit intervals of the 72-Tone Equally Distributed Octave. This work also features a number of devices taken from Henry Cowell's theoretical text, "New Musical Resources." Subsequently, this concert will also feature selections of newly realized versions of pieces from Kyle Gann's seminal work, "Hyperchromatica" in his 8x8 Just Intonation tuning. The evening will cap off with Clarence Barlow's work, "&#199;o&#x11F;luotob&uuml;si&#x15F;letmesi" for 4 retuned virtual pianos.
